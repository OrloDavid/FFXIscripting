# FFXI Scripting / Burnersware Original Source Code

Welcome to the archival repository for the original code of the FFXI Scripting / Burnersware software.

_Automating the game since 2003_

This repository contains the source code of software I created in what seems like several lifetimes ago. I've maintained the code, website, and hosting for years, along with IoCaine for Matt (hammy) Hampton.

It's always a surprise when someone signs up (and pays) for access, especially considering the site has been around for 20 years as of 2023, and the game it serves is only a year older.

### About Final Fantasy XI

For those unfamiliar, Final Fantasy XI Online (FFXI) was once one of the largest MMORPGs, second only to World of Warcraft, which has since been surpassed by FFXIV.

### The Journey of Development

When I began working on this project, my knowledge of programming, web design, and hosting was minimal. Learning to code opened up a world of possibilities, and I was determined to create something better, smarter, and undetectable.

The first bot was a breakthrough, and as the project expanded, it became clear that a GUI was necessary. At that time, AutoIt didn't have GUI support, except in a beta version. So, I took the plunge and wrote approximately 5,000 lines of code in the beta, which inevitably broke with the release of AutoIt's new version. Despite the setback, this allowed me to release the bots much earlier.

### The Coding Process

The GUI code was crafted by hand in Scite, a glorified Notepad, with no visual aidsâ€”just a lot of math and trial and error, including the creation of those fancy transparent, multi-shaped GUIs that became well-known in the community.

As a self-taught programmer, the code reflects my journey from a novice to what I would call a hobbyist programmer. It's far from professional standards at the time, so expect to see multiple `If..Then` statements instead of `Switch` or `Case` statements and a lack of `For..Next` loops where objects should have been used.

### Legacy and Learning

This code stands as a testament to my creativity and ability to leverage the tools at my disposal to create something unique or to solve problems that seemed insurmountable or required a high level of skill and creativity.
