# burnersware FFXI Automation Tools

Welcome to the official repository for burnersware, a suite of automation tools designed for the legendary MMORPG Final Fantasy XI. This collection encapsulates a journey of innovation, community, and undying nostalgia.

## Software & Bots

Rogue Tools, exclusively developed by burners, is a conglomeration of hand-coded bots designed to enhance the FFXI gaming experience:

- **Fishing Bot**: Automates fishing with features like auto-sort and bait management.
- **Provoke**: A straightforward NM hunting assistant.
- **Bard**: Automates bard skill leveling.
- **Enhance**: Aides in leveling WHM/BLM skills.
- **Summon**: Handles Summoner Bloodpact skill leveling.
- **Party**: Manages a skill-based support character in a group setting with extensive functionalities.
- **Power-Leveling**: Operates a high-level healer targeted at an individual, capable of following your character, managing MP/HP, and interpreting chat commands.

Advanced bots, such as the Power-Leveling bot, are intuitive enough to perform complex tasks, offering a hands-off gaming advantage.

## History & Legacy

In 2003, David Orlo, also known as *burners*, embarked on a coding adventure with FFXI Scripting. What started as a learning project burgeoned into an advanced, user-friendly automation suite. This required rapid scaling of coding prowess, diving into GUI creation when AutoIt's GUI capabilities were still in beta.

burners also ventured into web development, picking up HTML, CSS, PHP, and MYSQL to craft burnersware.com. During this period, he contributed to fixing the official PHPBB Paypal Integration Mod, which led to the creation of the rebranded and more descriptive FFXIScripting.com.

Joining forces in 2006, Matt Hampton (Hammy) and burners became the dynamic duo behind burnersware. Despite misconceptions of a larger team, it was just them against the world, each with their own software, style, and hobbies - albeit Hammy with his Aston Martin and burners with his arguably cooler bike.

When Fishing System 2.0 rolled out, burnersware's Rogue Hyper Fishing Bot outsmarted Square Enix's anti-botting measures, a testament to the ingenuity and resilience of burnersware. *Viva La burnersware* became the rallying cry, a community bonded over shared knowledge and mutual respect, and a symbol in the form of T-shirts worn with pride, even spotted at a Micro Center in Michigan pre-YouTube fame.

## burnersware Ethos

The lowercase *b* in burnersware isn't just a typographical choice; it's a nod to the humility and roots of a project that always aimed to stay grounded, authentic, and true to its community-driven spirit.
